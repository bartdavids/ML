# ML

I'm practicing machine learning application in Python and store some projects here.

The data map stores practice data. Mnist for the training of the heural network, and the wine quality dataset for the linear and logistic regression models. 

# Neural Network .py files

NN.py
- .py file where a simple neural network can be build, trained and run
- for those that like to read top-down in python

NN_as_class.py
- .py file containing the neural network builder and trainer as a class
- Example use in NN_as_class_input

NN_as_class_input.py
- Example use of the NN_as_class file

Known issues

Things I like to add
- Better tracking of performace (metrics)

# Regression

Linear_regression.py
- A file that stores a class for linear regression

Logistic regression.py
- Stores a class for logistic regression

Regression.py
- Examples useing the Linear and logistic regression classes
- Uses the wine quality dataset
- Compares linear and regression for similar problems
- Compares adam with gradient descent to compare performance
